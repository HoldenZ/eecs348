        Once upon a time, there was a potato who dreamed of becoming a french fry. But every time he tried to get crispy and golden,<br>
        he ended up getting burnt and mushy. So, he decided to attend a fry-cooking class to learn the tricks of the trade.<br>
        Unfortunately, he got paired with a carrot who kept whispering "you're too soft" every time the potato made a mistake.<br>
        Despite the carrot's negativity, the potato persevered and finally became a delicious french fry. And as for the carrot,<br>
        well, he ended up getting turned into a salad. The end.
